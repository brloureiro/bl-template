<i> PhD thesis template for the University of Cambridge </i>

This is a very simple and light template in LaTeX for a PhD thesis that complies with the University of Cambridge guidelines. 
<br/><br/>
There are robust templates available from other departments in the University, most notably:
<ul>
  <li>Krishna Kumar's Template: https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template</li>
  <li>University of Cambridge Computer Science template: https://github.com/cambridge/thesis/</li>
</ul>
But I found they had much more functionality than I needed, making it heavier and trickier to bespoke. So I wrote a (almost) minimal one for my needs. It includes two different title pages (the classic one similar to Krishna's and another similar to CS) and two options for the chapter headings.
