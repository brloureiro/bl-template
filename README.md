<i> PhD thesis template for the University of Cambridge </i>

This is a very simple and light template for a PhD thesis in LaTeX that complies with the University of Cambridge guidelines. 
<br/><br/>
There are robust templates available from other departments of the University, most notably:
<ul>
  <li>Krishna Kumar's Template: https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template</li>
  <li>University of Cambridge Computer Science template: https://github.com/cambridge/thesis/</li>
</ul>
But I found they had much more functionality than I needed, making it heavier and trickier to bespoke. So I wrote a (almost) minimal one for my needs. 

I largely benefited from ideas and code from the Dissertate templates: https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate
